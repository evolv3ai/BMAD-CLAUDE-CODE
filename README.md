# Claude Code, now with BMADness

**Into the unforgiving banality of software development we reflexively march, clutching our glowing API keys like torches against the impenetrable desolation of technical debt.** The BMAD Method - us mad be-ings expedition into the tarred ocean of AI-assisted creation - transforms the milquetoast ritual of "vibe coding" into misty charades evoking a mouth full of chalk and clandestine photographs. Nine specialized personas stand ready, a psychogeographical stonehenge coaxing us into treacherous mountain passes of token gathering, cataclismic tomfoolery, and the final commit: deploying a containerized singularity which compiled once last Thursday.

Here, in this repository, lies our decrepit documentation of the journey - templates gesturing at meaning imposed upon the gaping void, workflows pretending the machine cares about our deadlines, and a methodology born from the quixotic dreams of script kiddies daring to believe AI could hypnotize the savage beast of framework debates.

<summary><strong>üìã Setup Instructions</strong></summary>

### Manual Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Copy these to your project root:
   - `.bmad-core/` folder (personas, templates, tasks, checklists, data)
   - `CLAUDE.md` or `CLAUDE-ENHANCED.md` (rename to CLAUDE.md)
   - `BMAD-CLAUDE-CODE-GUIDE.md` (optional quick reference)
3. Create a `docs/` folder in your project for BMAD artifacts
4. Start using BMAD with Claude Code!

### Using BMAD with Claude Code

**Starting a New Project:**

```
User: "Let's plan a new app using BMAD"
Claude Code: I'll help you start a new BMAD project. Let me set up the planning structure...
```

**Continuing Work:**

```
User: "Continue BMAD planning"
Claude Code: I see we were working on the PRD as the Product Manager...
```

**Key Commands:**

- **"Act as the BMAD [Persona]"** - Claude adopts specific persona mindset
- **"Create a [document]"** - Uses appropriate BMAD template
- **"Run [checklist]"** - Executes quality validation
- **"Show planning status"** - Reviews progress and next steps

**Usage Examples:**

- **Direct Requests**: "Build authentication" ‚Üí [Developer] starts implementation
- **Create Documents**: "Create user stories" ‚Üí [PM] drafts stories
- **Design Systems**: "Design the database" ‚Üí [Data Engineer] creates schema
- **Quality Gates**: "Run architecture checklist" ‚Üí Validates design decisions

<summary><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Session Management Options</strong></summary>

### Basic Setup (CLAUDE.md)

Use for simple, single-session projects:

- Copy `CLAUDE.md` as-is to your project root
- No session tracking needed
- Best for small features or quick prototypes
- All planning happens in one session

### Enhanced Setup (CLAUDE-ENHANCED.md)

For complex, multi-session planning:

- Copy `CLAUDE-ENHANCED.md` to your project root and rename to `CLAUDE.md`
- Includes efficiency enhancements, session continuity, and planning journal support
- Best for full application development with extended planning phases

- **Quality Built-In**: Checklists and templates ensure nothing is missed
- **Context Preservation**: Never lose planning decisions across sessions
- **Role-Based Thinking**: Claude Code adopts appropriate mindsets for each phase
- **Document-Driven**: All artifacts are markdown files, easy to review and version

### BMAD Workflow Phases

- Architecture patterns for scalability and maintainability
- API specifications and security modeling
- User experience flows and interface design

#### 4. Implementation & Quality

**Developer** persona builds the solution:

- Clean code implementation following best practices
- Debugging and refactoring for maintainability
- Technical documentation and code reviews

**QA Engineer** persona ensures quality:

- Test strategy design and test automation
- Performance and security testing
- Independent quality validation

#### 5. Data Management

**Data Engineer** persona architects information flow:

- Database schema design and optimization
- Data migration and ETL pipeline creation
- Privacy compliance and data governance

#### 6. Infrastructure & Operations

**DevOps Engineer** persona enables deployment:

- CI/CD pipeline setup and automation
- Infrastructure design and monitoring
- Security hardening and cost optimization

#### 7. Process & Continuity

**Orchestrator** persona maintains project discipline:

- Quality gates and validation checkpoints
